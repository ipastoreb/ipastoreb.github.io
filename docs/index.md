## I - WHAT IS PRAXIS



![](https://i.ibb.co/z5nzVj9/Imagen1.png)
Figure 1. *Praxis is far more than a simple charter.  It manages your clinic by learning from your past.  Here we see Clinical Practice Guidelines which turn into Prospective Queries to dramatically improve MIPS to close to 100% in attestations without much effort.*

The paper-record paradigm is dead.  The way we were taught to chart was based on a time when all we had was just that: dead paper. Today, our computer presents to us a fascinating new way to document and think, a rational and simple alternative approach to practice medicine faster, easier and better. Wasting hours a day charting and playing data-entry clerk makes no sense at all. By so doing, we providers missed the obvious, which this alternative approach to charting and practicing medicine resolves. Practicing medicine is not about charting anyway, and much less about bureaucracy, if it ever was. Medicine is not about computers either, except in that they are supposed to help, and not hinder, our work.  The staggering amount of time wasted in computer tasks using traditional EHRs is simply a dismal destruction of healthcare resources and of patient and professional well-being. Praxis presents a practical alternative, a new method to chart instantly and practice medicine easier and better. Praxis helps your patients and your practice by working with your mind and not against it. Perhaps, it might even protect your sanity.

Yes, with Praxis you chart backwards, and this may initially seem strange.  However, you will quickly find that what appears to be charting backwards makes sense:  It's better medicine, easier medicine, and certainly, much faster medicine to do what you wrote than to write what you did.  However, because this counterintuitive approach to charting medicine flies against our ingrained training, it takes a bit to get used at first, but, then again, our ingrained training was formed at a time when there were no computers around, when all we had was just that, dead paper. How could have we been trained otherwise?  To make things worse, all the other EHR ported this dead-paper-record paradigm into their computers unchanged, simply adding electric typewriters, plenty of macros, templates and picklists for good measure.  In so doing they turned a bad thing into something horrible.  No wonder providers are going crazy with their computers!

You will quickly find yourself charting at the speed of your mind, and the speed of your mind is much faster than the speed of your mouth, to say nothing of your frail fingers.

By the way, in this manual as in all our documentation we call Praxis an Electronic **Medical** Record (EMR) as opposed to an Electronic **Healthcare** Record (EHR). This term, _EMR_, is not a typo or a misnomer.  It turns out that computer software is not neutral or a fit-for-all. Good software must take sides and be biased on the side of its users. An EMR works for the busy provider and his or her staff in the clinic, hence its proud name. Other "electronic healthcare record" systems may cater to insurance companies and the government—good for them—and still others cater to the patient. By the way, the Praxis patient portal was also developed with the medical provider mind. Its goal is fundamentally to assist your practice in its relation with your patients, and, as a result of this approach your patients will also benefit. Nevertheless, it is simply another clinical tool to assist you in the performance of your daily tasks by empowering your patients to do some of them for you, such as scheduling, intake forms, and information gathering, as well as to protect you medicolegally. In short, the term _EMR_ is the one we use throughout this manual when referring to Praxis, even though officially Praxis is a certified EHR by federal standards [^1].

Now, if you can step back a bit to look at the big picture and consider the very purpose of practicing medicine, this uniquely different charting approach begins to make sense. You will find that your initial effort to learn this program is more than worthwhile when compared to the huge amount of time saved during your professional career. A typical provider in primary care is _wasting_ an average of two hours every day of his or her life by simply playing data-entry clerk in front of the computer. This time waste is equivalent to about seven years of a professional life thrown down the  bureaucratic garbage.  Sparing you from this nightmare is certainly worth the few weeks you will need to learn Praxis effectively. Moreover, you will find that learning this program is an intellectually stimulating and even enjoyable experience.  Praxis should be approached the way you have pursued any other important clinical skill, such as reading electrocardiograms or interpreting x-rays.  That is, the study of Praxis should be set up as formal medical training program rather than as something to get over with as quickly as possible. If you approach your training carefully and methodically, you will find the learning this EMR worthwhile and even enjoyable. Yes, Praxis does not know medicine and cannot diagnose your patient, but it sure learns your mind!  And it is your mind, and not the patient nor anyone else, which is performing all the charting, practicing, and thinking in medicine.  So, a tool that empowers your mind to accomplish its ends becomes an amazing help to you and to your practice. So, please slow down with this learning. This way of charting will soon become intuitive.

We begin with the scientific fact that our minds process—not words, and certainly not letters—but abstract concepts which leap into our consciousness suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere. Praxis calls these concepts _Units of Thought_.  Our minds express these Units of Thought, representing personal concepts, instantly and semi-consciously. As soon as your thoughts appear in your mind and you accept them as valid, your subconscious automatically generates its related words, phrases, sentences, and even entire paragraphs instantly, which you then speak or type semi-automatically.  You are certainly not aware of every word you utter or type­, clearly not of every single letter. Imagine, then, a computer program that could handle this second part­: the automatic text generation starting from your own units of thought­ by learning from your past use, and that then turns these units of thought into your own words, phrases, paragraphs, and even documents, all at once and without errors. Imagine further, that a computer program could instantly and automatically display the relevant text you need even before you think you need it.  And then imagine an EMR which could link each of your units of thought to your other units of thought, again by learning from your own past, always refining your thinking with every patient you see and with every visit you encounter.  Imagine your computer advising you at the point of care as a personal assistant which keeps improving with time.  Indeed, as we stated, Praxis does not know medicine and cannot know how to treat your patient, but it sure learns how your mind thinks, and that's enough to make a huge difference in the quality of documentation, reduction of clinical errors, and time savings.

Figure 2. *Units of thought encapsulate of words, phrases, and entire paragraphs that you use repetitively and semi-automatically.  When you think "well developed, well nourished male..." (or whatever way you say it), you are not thinking of each individual word­—certainly not of every individual letter­—you pronounce. These words simply emanate from your subconscious, activating the muscles in your mouth, or those of your fingertips to type semi-automatically. The same logic applies to the other descriptors above. Look, for example, at  "Prednisone tablets tapering dose...on day one, take 6 tablets, on day two take 5 tablets..." an instantaneous concept translated semi-consciously into a complex set of words that you must then enter manually on your medication script or type into your computer. It is this secondary "translation" which causes the horrendous waste of  time and effort, sometimes resulting in inexcusable errors, which Praxis resolves with great ease.*


Finally, you will find that Praxis is not just about great documentation at great speed. Using Praxis your encounter note comes alive and begins to undertake tasks on your behalf, becoming a medical assistant and a second medical brain.  There is no disconnect between what you chart and what you do.  Praxis helps you think and act through your case exactly the way you handle it, as a sort-of teleprompter for your mind.  Praxis thinks and acts like you, but you are always in control the way you are when you drive your car. If you can think of your automobile as an extension of your muscles, which it empowers many times, then Praxis is an extension of your thoughts in the same way.

Figure 3. *Praxis is more than just charting. The Venn Diagrams in color represent the charting features of Praxis. The others circles displayed in the periphery represent smart applications which also learn from your past to perform actions on your behalf at the same time as your note is charted. They spare you from the need to manually perform tasks in your practice while reducing clinical errors.*

Your computer will suggest what you wish displayed and done even before you realize you need it. You simply approve what you see on the monitor screen, and you are done.  You've not only instantly charted it, but the displayed orders get automatically carried out on your behalf as well.  Multiple prescriptions with all the dosage fields properly filled out and sent to the pharmacy; complex lab orders and/or studies, instantly generated and sent to appropriate recipients; letters to referring providers and/or consulting physicians; patient instructions, handouts, admitting orders; individualized communication to your patients via the patient portal, even your routing slip for billing, all instantly completed with your note at the same time with a single click of your mouse. And, the best part? You've taught it all it knows. The action tasks are always accomplished exactly your way, or you may amend them on the fly, and if you do, these improvements are learned for the future. As a result, the more you use this program the less you have to amend, the faster it works, and the better it handles your practice. The software progressively learns to practice the way you do at your best by not letting you overlook anything. Praxis has perfect memory.

This EMR lowers clinical errors simply because what you are doing is not really creating a clinical history, although it may look like a wonderful one when you are completed.  It actually works backwards! Your clinical history doubles as a smart check-list, which then reminds you at the point of care of what you yourself wish to think about and handle during the patient encounter, ensuring that nothing is forgotten or overlooked. Therefore, if the most similar previous case was performed correctly, all your t's are crossed and your i's are dotted for this case as well. You cannot forget to ask crucial questions, check critical findings, order appropriate medications. or generate important studies, as your own note doubles as an effective checklist for the case. On the other hand, were you to discover an error coming from the previous closest case you've done in the past and correct it now, you cannot make the same mistake ever again. Ergo, the more you use the program the less random errors you make. And since random errors make up the vast majority of mistakes in medicine—in particular the indefensible ones—then the quality of medicine you practice progressively increases.
